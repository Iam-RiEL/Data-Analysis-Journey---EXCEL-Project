 # Data-Analysis-Journey---EXCEL-Project
## This is a documentation of my EXCEL lesson Project. 

In a bid to solidify my knowledge of  __EXCEL__ as a student of Biomedical Engineering aiming to delve into Data Analysis and research, I decided to work on a __Mental Health survey of Workers__. 

## Project Topic: Mental Health Risk of Remote Workers
### Table Of Content

### Project Overview

The younger generation of workers mostly believe that remote work is a flex. While that might seem true, in regard to flexibility and freedom, it still does not guarantee that remote workers would be exempted from other issues like the mental health risk, that a conventional employee might have to deal with in the work space. 

The mental health of workers is a very crucial topic to consider. And while remote work seem like an escape route, this analysis aims to bring perspective to how much remote workers are likely to be at risk of mental health issues.
